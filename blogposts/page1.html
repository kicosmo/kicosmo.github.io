    <h1>Walking through withdrawl</h1>
    <p>Withdrawal is an endurance sport.</p>
    <p>It will not feel good but should it? Your body is attempting to heal, to rectify what you have done and it is no easy task. So endure.</p>
    <p>Think back to why you’re doing this, travel to the moments of shame, anger and sheer frustration at your self. Bathe in it.</p>
    <p>Once you’ve woken up, start walking forward. The ground will be either too hot or too cold but walk. Endure.</p>
    <p>Remember all you need to do is be, time will move forward as it always has. And while it does you will feel the chains begin to break as the everlasting current bashes against them. But while it bashes against them it bashes against you as well.</p>
    <p>So endure well.</p>
